    I'm a senior software engineer and solution architect in Oxfordshire, UK.

    I've been designing, implementing, deploying and supporting software professionally since 2011, but I've written code since the late 1980s.
    I'm also an experienced technical team lead, and have been [certified by AWS](https://cp.certmetrics.com/amazon/en/public/verify/credential/PECRMDKK52RQ1PWK) as a Solutions Architect: Associate.

    On this site, I write about my experience, my hobbies, my knowledge, and any other thoughts I may have.
    If you find anything interesting here, please do [get in touch](#contact) as it makes me very happy to discuss and share.

  title: "About Me"
  image: "/images/about-me-photo.jpg"
  content: |-
    I live and love software!
    I was born in Kent in the early 1980s and was fascinated by electronics of the time.
    Growing up, I learned how to write code for computers like the ZX Spectrum 128k +2.
    As I went through my education, my skills adapted to Microsoft Visual Basic and then Java.

    However, despite all the above, I actually followed an education in biology, gaining my undergraduate degree in Zoology, a masters in Bioinformatics, and finally a combined masters and PhD in Systems Biology at the University of Warwick.
    I have been in my first career job since 2011 where I have grown into a technical team lead and a solution architect.
    I work with clients to determine their requirements and I design solutions that solve their business needs.

    My primary interests in software development revolve around enabling the team to work smoothly and improving user experience so that the solution is loved by the end users.
    I have had a large number of years experience in mobile app development and the services the app needs to function, and I have a particular passion for this type of development.

    In my downtime I enjoy photography; reading fact and fiction books; electronics design and repair; as well as playing video games.
