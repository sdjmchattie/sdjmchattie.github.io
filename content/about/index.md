Hi!
I'm Stuart McHattie and I've been writing code since I was 6 years old.
I studied Zoology followed by Bioinformatics and then completed a PhD in Systems Biology.
Since 2011 I've been working as a Consultant Software Engineer and developing my skills in a large number of disciplines.
Outside work I enjoy photography; reading fact and fiction books; electronics design and repair; as well as playing video games.

When it comes to software, I've always had a passion for it.
As a child, I wanted to work with animals and aimed to become a veterinary surgeon.
But as I progressed through my education, I realised that if I didn't go with my gut feeling and my natural interest in software and computing, I would regret it.
So I applied my skills to my studies and eventually started work in 2011 as a Software Engineer.
The list of technologies I understand and have experience in are vast and I've become excellent at both choosing the best technology for the problem and using those technology choices like a specialist would.

Languages and frameworks which I consider to have exceptional experience in include:

- Python (including Flask)
- Ruby (including Ruby on Rails)
- Containerisation via Docker
- Infrastructure deployment via Terraform and Ansible
- Databases (MySQL, MongoDB, Microsoft Sequel Server and Postgres to name a few)
- Source control with Git and vast experience of GitHub, GitLab and Azure DevOps

Languages and frameworks which I consider to have strong experience in and could apply to new work easily include:

- iOS development in Objective-C and Swift
- Android development in Java and Kotlin
- Javascript web development in Vue.js
- Static web development in Hugo

Over my career so far I've come to learn that languages and frameworks are great and you should have experience in a good number of them to know what is possible.
However, a team is not a team without a leader and I have enjoyed taking on the responsibility of technical team lead at times.
Most recently, I have been working on becoming a software solution architect and I have taken and passed certification by Amazon Web Services for this role.
Leading others and making decisions on the direction of the work is the natural step beyond software writing expertise and it allows others to grow into the role you have already forged a path for.

I love helping others; if I can help you please do reach out to give me the opportunity!
