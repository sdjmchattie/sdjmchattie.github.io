This is an overview of the current state of Python package management in 2025.
You can find this and other posts by browsing the [Python]({{< ref "/tags/python" >}}) tag.

Package management is a critical part of modern software engineering.
It allows developers to declare, install, and isolate project dependencies in a reliable and repeatable way.
This is critical when working on software that you expect others to use, because if any dependency is missing or the wrong version, your code may not run correctly.

In this article, we’ll take a look at four popular Python package managers: Conda, Pipenv, Poetry, and UV.
Each has its own strengths, weaknesses, and ideal use cases.

We’ll explore how to install each tool, how to define dependencies, and what to do when preparing a project for production deployment.
Whether you're managing a data science environment, a web application, or a CLI tool, there's a package manager best suited for your needs.

Let’s dive in.

## Comparison Overview

| Package Manager       | Strengths | Weaknesses | Best For |
|-----------------------|-----------|------------|----------|
| [**Conda**](#conda)   | Cross-platform, handles both Python and non-Python dependencies, great for data science | Large environments, slower creation, commercial license required for Anaconda distribution | Data science, machine learning |
| [**Pipenv**](#pipenv) | Simple and integrates well with `pip` and virtualenv, good for web apps | Not as robust for non-Python dependencies | General Python applications, web development |
| [**Poetry**](#poetry) | Dependency resolution and version management, easy to use for Python apps | Slightly newer, fewer integrations | Python projects, libraries, and packaging |
| [**UV**](#uv)         | Lightweight and minimal, integrates well with `pip` | Less feature-rich than the others, limited to Python | Lightweight Python environments, quick prototyping |

## Conda

Conda is a cross-platform package and environment manager that is especially popular in the data science and machine learning communities.
It supports not just Python packages, but also native libraries and packages from other languages such as R, C, and C++.
This makes it particularly useful when working with scientific libraries that have complex dependencies.

### Conda Strengths

Conda environments are self-contained and can include compiled binaries and non-Python dependencies.
This makes it easier to set up reproducible environments across different systems.
The `conda` tool is generally user-friendly and supports creating, exporting, and cloning environments.

Conda can also install packages from both its own repositories and PyPI, giving it broad package coverage.

### Conda Weaknesses

Conda environments can be large and sometimes slower to create compared to other tools.
While the core functionality is robust, some packages are only available in specific Conda channels like `conda-forge`, requiring additional configuration.
It's also less commonly used for lightweight applications or simple Python scripts.

### Licensing Note

If you're using Conda in a commercial or enterprise setting, it's important to be aware of licensing restrictions.
The **Anaconda distribution** and the **default Conda channel** provided by Anaconda, Inc. now require a paid commercial license for business use.
This can lead to compliance issues if you're installing packages without proper licensing.

To avoid this, you can switch to using the community-maintained `conda-forge` channel, which is freely available and not subject to the same restrictions.
To do this, configure your environment to use `conda-forge` by default:

```sh
conda config --add channels conda-forge
conda config --set channel_priority strict
```

This ensures that your packages are pulled from `conda-forge` instead of the commercial defaults channel.
The `strict` priority setting avoids mixing packages from multiple sources, which can reduce dependency conflicts.

### Installing Conda

The easiest way to install Conda is via [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html), a minimal installer that includes just the Conda tool and Python.
Avoid the full Anaconda distribution unless you have a commercial license or are using it personally.

After downloading and running the installer, you’ll have access to the `conda` command.

```sh
conda --version
```

### Creating a Conda Environment

To create a new environment:

```sh
conda create --name myenv python=3.12
```

To activate the environment:

```sh
conda activate myenv
```

To install dependencies:

```sh
conda install numpy pandas matplotlib
```

If you've configured your channels correctly, these will be installed from `conda-forge`.

### Managing Conda Dependencies

To export the environment so it can be reproduced elsewhere:

```sh
conda env export > environment.yml
```

To recreate the environment on another system:

```sh
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

### Deploying Conda Environments to Production

In production, you can use the `environment.yml` file to ensure your application runs with the exact same dependencies.
This is useful for deploying to servers or running batch jobs where reproducibility is key.

Some production environments, especially in data science and machine learning, support running entire Conda environments directly using tools like [conda-pack](https://conda.github.io/conda-pack/) or [Docker with Conda](https://hub.docker.com/r/continuumio/miniconda).

## Pipenv

Pipenv is a Python packaging tool that combines `pip` and `virtualenv` into one simple command line interface.
It is designed to provide a more manageable way to handle dependencies for Python applications.
Pipenv automatically creates and manages a virtual environment for your projects, as well as adds/removes packages from your `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock`.

### Pipenv Strengths

Pipenv is easy to use and provides a clear separation of development and production dependencies.
It integrates well with `pip` and `virtualenv`, so you don't need to worry about manually managing virtual environments.
The `Pipfile.lock` ensures that everyone working on the project uses the same version of dependencies, which is important for reproducibility.

Additionally, Pipenv supports installing from both PyPI and GitHub repositories, making it versatile.

### Pipenv Weaknesses

Pipenv is not as robust when it comes to handling non-Python dependencies, and it can be a bit slower compared to Conda.
It also lacks some of the more advanced features of other package managers, such as automatic resolution of conflicting dependencies.
For larger or more complex projects, you may encounter issues with dependency resolution.

### Installing Pipenv

To install Pipenv, you can use `pip`:

```sh
pip install pipenv
```

You can verify the installation by checking the version:

```sh
pipenv --version
```

### Creating a Pipenv Environment

Pipenv automatically creates a virtual environment when you first install a package, so the following command will set up both the environment and the `Pipfile`:

```sh
pipenv install numpy pandas
```

To activate the environment:

```sh
pipenv shell
```

To install development dependencies (e.g., testing tools):

```sh
pipenv install --dev pytest
```

### Managing Pipenv Dependencies

To check the installed dependencies and their versions, you can view the `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock`.

To install all dependencies listed in the `Pipfile`:

```sh
pipenv install
```

To update a package:

```sh
pipenv update numpy
```

To uninstall a package:

```sh
pipenv uninstall numpy
```

### Deploying Pipenv Environments to Production

To deploy a project to production, you can use the `Pipfile.lock` to ensure that the exact versions of all dependencies are installed.
To generate the `Pipfile.lock`:

```sh
pipenv lock
```

In production, you can use the following to install the exact dependencies:

```sh
pipenv install --deploy --ignore-pipfile
```

This command will only use the `Pipfile.lock` to ensure that the same versions are installed on production machines.

## Poetry

Poetry is a modern Python dependency management and packaging tool that simplifies the management of project dependencies, packaging, and versioning.
It uses a `pyproject.toml` file for configuration, which is the new standard in Python packaging.
Poetry is designed to make it easy to create and maintain Python projects by providing a consistent, intuitive interface for managing dependencies.

### Poetry Strengths

Poetry excels at dependency resolution and version management, ensuring that all of your project's dependencies are compatible with each other.
It provides an automatic way to create and manage virtual environments, and it handles both development and production dependencies with ease.
Poetry's `pyproject.toml` is a standardized file format that works with many modern Python tools, and it allows for easy packaging and distribution of your projects.

Like Pipenv, Poetry locks dependency versions with a `poetry.lock` file, ensuring reproducible builds across different environments.

### Poetry Weaknesses

Poetry is still relatively new compared to other package managers, so it may not be as well-integrated with some older tools or libraries.
It also has a steeper learning curve for beginners, as it introduces new concepts like `pyproject.toml` and a different approach to dependency resolution.
While it supports non-Python dependencies, it doesn't handle them as well as Conda, so it's better suited for Python-centric projects.

### Installing Poetry

To install Poetry, use the following command to download and run the installer:

```sh
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```

You can verify the installation by checking the version:

```sh
poetry --version
```

### Creating a Poetry Environment

To create a new Poetry project, navigate to your project directory and run:

```sh
poetry new my_project
```

This will generate a new directory with the necessary files for your project, including the `pyproject.toml` file.

To add a dependency (e.g., `numpy`):

```sh
poetry add numpy
```

To install all dependencies from the `pyproject.toml`:

```sh
poetry install
```

### Managing Poetry Dependencies

Poetry provides simple commands for adding, updating, and removing dependencies.

To add a development dependency (e.g., `pytest`):

```sh
poetry add --dev pytest
```

To update a specific package:

```sh
poetry update numpy
```

To remove a package:

```sh
poetry remove numpy
```

### Deploying Poetry to Production

To prepare for deployment, you should ensure that your `poetry.lock` file is up-to-date.
To generate the `poetry.lock`:

```sh
poetry lock
```

In production, you can use the following command to install the exact versions specified in the lock file:

```sh
poetry install --no-dev
```

This will ensure that only the production dependencies are installed on the production machine, ensuring consistency and reproducibility across environments.

## UV

UV is a fast, lightweight Python package manager developed by Astral, designed for speed and simplicity.
It aims to be a drop-in replacement for `pip` and `virtualenv`, with dramatically faster dependency resolution and installation.
UV is written in Rust and is focused on Python-only workflows.

Because of its speed, UV is ideal for developers who value quick iteration and minimal overhead.

### UV Strengths

The standout feature of UV is performance: dependency resolution and package installation are significantly faster than traditional tools like `pip`.
UV integrates tightly with Python's `pyproject.toml` standard, making it a natural fit for modern Python projects.
It supports both installing dependencies and creating isolated environments, replacing both `pip` and `virtualenv`.

UV also provides better caching and deterministic installs via its lock file, which improves reproducibility.

### UV Weaknesses

UV is still relatively new, and while it's rapidly improving, it lacks some of the more advanced features of tools like Poetry or Conda.
It doesn't handle non-Python dependencies (e.g., system libraries) at all, so it’s not suitable for environments that need compiled libraries or system-level packages.
The ecosystem around UV is still maturing, so some tooling and documentation may be limited compared to more established managers.

### Installing UV

You can install UV using a pre-built binary via the `install.sh` script from the official source:

```sh
curl -Ls https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

After installation, you can verify it's working:

```sh
uv --version
```

UV can also be installed via Homebrew on macOS:

```sh
brew install astral-sh/uv/uv
```

### Creating a UV Environment

UV doesn’t use the traditional `virtualenv`.
Instead, it creates and manages its own isolated environment in the `.venv` directory.

To create an environment and add packages from `pyproject.toml`:

```sh
uv venv
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or, if you're using a `pyproject.toml` file (as you would with Poetry):

```sh
uv pip install .
```

To install new packages into your environment:

```sh
uv pip install requests
```

### Managing UV Dependencies

To freeze your environment into a lock file:

```sh
uv pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

To install all dependencies from a lock file:

```sh
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Since UV is compatible with `pip`, you can manage dependencies using standard `pip` commands.
However, because UV is so fast, these operations complete much more quickly than with vanilla `pip`.

### Deploying UV to Production

For production environments, the recommended workflow is to:

1. Create a lock file with exact versions:

    ```sh
    uv pip freeze > requirements.txt
    ```

2. Commit the `requirements.txt` to your repository.

3. In production, recreate the environment and install dependencies:

    ```sh
    uv venv
    uv pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

This ensures fast, reproducible installs that work seamlessly in CI/CD pipelines or cloud deployments.
