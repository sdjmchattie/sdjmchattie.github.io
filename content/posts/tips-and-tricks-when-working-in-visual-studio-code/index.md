Visual Studio Code is an amazingly competent development tool from Microsoft and amazingly it's free.
I use it every day in my professional career and, through years of use, I've become very familiar with how it works.
When you gain this sort of familiarity with a piece of software, you forget the struggles you had initially and the optimisations you apply to get more out of the tool.
I recognised this recently when I was working with fellow engineers and performing these tricks in front of them.
They were saying "How did you do that?" and "I had no idea you could do that!".
So I thought I'd share some of the tips I'm aware of so that others can get that warm fuzzy feeling of knowing how to shortcut typical problems during development.
