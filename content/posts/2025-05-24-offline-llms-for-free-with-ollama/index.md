## What Is Ollama and Why Run LLMs Locally?

### What Is Ollama?

Ollama is a user-friendly platform designed to simplify local deployment of large language models.
It offers a clean graphical interface alongside a model marketplace, making it effortless to find, download, and manage models on your machine.
Built for both casual hobbyists and serious developers, Ollama streamlines the process, removing the need for complex setup or cloud dependency.
But most importantly, it is completely free to use.

### Why Should You Run LLMs Locally?

- **Privacy & Data Security**: Keep your sensitive data on your device; no third-party servers involved.
- **Offline Accessibility**: Work anywhere—even in remote locations or low-bandwidth environments.
- **Cost Efficiency**: No subscription fees—just the cost of running your computer.

## Popular Ollama Models and Hardware Considerations

### Commonly Used Models Available in Ollama

| Model Name        | Parameters | Download Size | Context Size |
|-------------------|------------|---------------|--------------|
| [`llama3.1:8b`](https://ollama.com/library/llama3.1)       | 8 billion  | 4.9 GB | 128k |
| [`deepseek-r1:8b`](https://ollama.com/library/deepseek-r1) | 8 billion  | 4.9 GB | 128k |
| [`mistral:7b`](https://ollama.com/library/mistral)         | 7 billion  | 4.1 GB | 32k  |
| [`gemma3:12b`](https://ollama.com/library/gemma3)          | 12 billion | 8.1 GB | 128k |

*Note:* the parameter sizes shown above are a demonstration of a reasonable sized model for running locally.
Other options exist, so select a model name in the table above to see which other options might suit your use case better.

### Hardware Requirements

Running these models requires varying machine resources such as processing power, RAM and storage.
Generally, the smaller the number of parameters, the lower the resources required, but lower numbers of parameters tend to hallucinate more and get easily confused.
Ollama will inform you if the model you've chosen will not run on your machine.
The models are very RAM heavy, so the more RAM you have, the better.
If Ollama detects that you have GPU resources available, it will use them automatically as these are the most efficient way to run an LLM.

    ```

### On Windows

1. Download the Windows installer from [Ollama’s site](https://ollama.com).
2. Run the installer and follow the setup wizard.
3. For advanced users, consider installing Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) and running Ollama within Linux environments.

### On Linux

1. Run the command shown on the [Ollama website](https://ollama.com):

    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
    ```

2. Verify installation:

## Getting a Model Up and Running

### Post-Installation: Browsing & Downloading Models

1. Launch your terminal.
2. Search [Ollama's model listing](https://ollama.com/search) to find the model you want to download.
3. Download the model by specifying the name in a command such as that shown:

```bash
ollama pull llama3.1:8b
```

### Running a Model

Start interacting with the LLM via the terminal:

```bash
ollama run llama3.1:8b
```

This opens an interactive prompt:

```plaintext
> What is the capital of France?
Paris
```

Responses will be displayed inline to allow you to try different models before committing to one for a development project.

## Using Ollama’s API for Seamless AI Integration

### Overview of the API

Ollama exposes a local API to facilitate automation and integration with tools like AutoGen, CrewAI, and LangGraph.
This turns your machine into a powerful AI development hub.

Ollama should already be running on your machine, and if so you can visit [http://localhost:11434](http://localhost:11434) in your local browser and it will tell you "Ollama is running".
If it turns out to not be running, you can start it in a terminal using the following command:

```bash
ollama serve
```

### Basic API Usage

You can send requests to the API using a simple `curl` command:

```bash
curl http://localhost:11434/api/generate -d '{
  "model": "llama3.1:8b",
  "prompt": "Tell me a joke"
}'
```

The above streams output tokens one at a time.
If you want to get the whole response at once, you can turn off streaming in your request:

```bash
curl http://localhost:11434/api/generate -d '{
  "model": "llama3.1:8b",
  "prompt": "Tell me a joke",
  "stream": false
}'
```

The API response could then be used for embedding or inclusion in a response to a user in your own applications.

### Automate & Extend

Integrate the API into scripts or frameworks.
An example usage in Python:

```python
import requests

response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:11434/api/generate",
    json={"model": "llama3.1:8b", "prompt": "Write a short story.", "stream": False}
)
print(response.json()['response'])
```

This opens automation possibilities, enabling complex workflows and AI-powered applications locally.
